"""Per-session cache of embedded snippet call results (spec 2026-07-20 §3.1).

Sound because of the WASM runner's determinism guarantee: same code + same
model ⇒ same output, so a result keyed by (code hash, entry, element ids) is
valid for as long as the model doesn't change. "The model didn't change" is
tracked by a REV STAMP rather than rev-in-key: `Session.touch_model`/
`set_model` call `clear_and_stamp(new_rev)`, and `put`/`get` at any other rev
are no-ops/misses — the same sampled-rev poisoning guard the table order
cache uses (a request that computed against a superseded model must never
write into the fresh cache; evaluation runs outside any lock, so a lost race
merely recomputes).

Self-stamping: a `put` at a rev NEWER than the stamp clears and re-stamps.
This covers paths that advance `model_rev` without running the invalidation
hooks (e.g. hydration assigning the DB-authoritative rev) — without it the
cache would silently reject every write until the next commit.

Error results: only DETERMINISTIC kinds (`runtime`, `syntax`) are cached —
they reproduce identically, so recomputing them is pure waste. Environmental
kinds (`timeout`, `unavailable`, `memory`, `cancelled`, and the synthetic
`pending`) must stay retryable and are silently not stored; `put` enforces
this itself so no caller can poison the cache with a transient failure.
Cached deterministic errors carry whatever `reads` their call reported
(usually `None` — errored calls ship no read-set — so they are evicted by
every commit; conservative and cheap).

Selective eviction (`evict_touched`, spec 2026-07-21 Phase B): each entry now
carries the read-set (`frozenset[ReadKey] | None`) its call reported
alongside the `CallResult`, so a commit that only touched a known subset of
the model can drop just the cells that read what changed instead of the
whole cache. See `evict_touched`'s docstring for the exact contract.

        read-keys are in hand. Drops every entry whose read-set intersects
        `touched` — or whose read-set is `None`, meaning "depends on
        everything" (pre-read-set result, overflow, errored call) — and
        re-stamps the survivors to `rev` IN PLACE: they were computed against
        state this commit provably did not touch, so they carry forward
        rather than recompute. A survivor therefore hits at the new rev and
        misses at the old one (the stamp has moved out from under it).

        `rev != stamp + 1` degrades to clear-all: some path moved the rev
        without coming through here (a legacy `touch_model`/`set_model` full
        clear, a rev jump during hydration, or a stale stamp surviving a lazy
        period), so the intermediate history between the old stamp and `rev`
        is unknown and keeping anything would be a guess. Over-invalidation
        is always the safe direction — this mirrors `put`'s self-stamping
        rule but is stricter (that one accepts any newer rev; this one
        insists on exactly +1 because keeping survivors requires knowing
